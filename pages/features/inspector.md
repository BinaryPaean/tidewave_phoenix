# Inspector

Tidewave includes a default inspector integrated with our coding agent.

## Usage

You can find the inspector on the top right of your browser window. Once enabled, you can hover page elements:

![Inspector example](assets/inspector.png)

Once you click an element, the chat box will show an element is currently inspected:

<img src="assets/inspecting.png" alt="Update chat with inspected element" width="400px">

If you send a message, Tidewave will include precise information about that element, such as its location on the page, part of its contents, as well as the server-side templates and client components involved in rendering the particular element.

## Shortcuts

The inspector supports the following shortcuts:

* Alt+Click or Cmd+Click (macOS): when hovering an element, you may Alt+Click it, and Tidewave will open up the element in your editor using your configured [editor integration](editors.md)
